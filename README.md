# Sign_language_recognition
A simple sign language recognition notebook which uses the 'Sign Language Digits Dataset'. Due to the implementation of barebones logistic regression, it can only classify between 2 signs : 0 and 1. This can be modified to classify any 2 signs in the dataset, like 1 and 2 or 5 and 7 and so on.

# Sign_language_recognition
A simple sign language recognition notebook which uses the 'Sign Language Digits Dataset'. Due to the implementation of barebones logistic regression, it can only classify between 2 signs , 0 and 1 in the first notebook. The second notebook classifies between 2 and 3. This can be modified to classify any 2 signs in the dataset, like 1 and 2 or 5 and 7 and so on. 
if the notebook doesnt render, paste the URLs of the notebooks into the search bar in https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.
